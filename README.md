# GDPack
A small program I made for myself that manages Geometry Dash texture packs. Written in C++

## Building from source
At the moment you can only build this from source. This is how I do it.

- Install CMake Tools for VSCode
- F1 -> CMake: Configure
- Build it using the button in the bottom bar or by pressing F7

You can do this with commands, but CMake is too big a monster for me to manage that.
